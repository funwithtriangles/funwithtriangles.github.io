        I'm Alex Kempton, a creative developer and artist working with new
        technologies to create interesting visual experiences, with a focus on
        the web. I am the creator of Hedron, visual artist for Polyop and
        creative director at Nudibranch Records.

      <p>
        For me it’s always important to have fun on a project and I’m often
        happiest when working with new tools. AR and VR is an exciting place to
        be at the moment, especially as this is now something that can be
        achieved on a website! I’m always looking for projects with an
        interesting visual or interactive element.

        <li>Leapwerm - Rather trippy Instagram filter</li>
        <li>Instatrip - Face filters for the web</li>

      <h2>10+ Years an Engineer</h2>
      <p>
        I’ve been solving problems with code since 2010. As much as I enjoy
        artistic projects, I’m a programmer at heart and am always looking to
        get my teeth into something technical. Past jobs include being the lead
        front-end developer for the build of an online banking interface, as
        well as creating custom data visualisations for financial reporting
        tools.

      <h2>Art for Music</h2>
      <p>
        I’m lucky to have had the opportunity to work with various musicians
        over the years. As well as creating and performing live visuals for
        Polyop, I’ve produced various pieces for other artists too, such as
        album artwork and music videos.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm particularly proud of the Nudibranch compilation album,
        <i>Molecular Selections</i>. As well as the main artwork, I created
        animations and even a UV printed cassette tape!
