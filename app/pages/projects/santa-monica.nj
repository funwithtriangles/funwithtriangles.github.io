<h2>The best of both worlds</h2>
<p>As someone who was making Flash websites before knowing anything about HTML, I’ve always had a soft spot for the “swooshy”. However we all know that Flash is dead and shouldn’t be used to create websites. Luckily we’re living in new age of web technology where all sorts of fun things can be incorporated into a modern website, while still adhering to best practice.</p>

<h2>Greensock is amazing</h2>

<p>Greensock (or more specifically GSAP) is a Javascript library that makes it easy for developers to implement complex animation that’s incredibly fast and efficient while being compatible with every browser you’d need it to be. For this project I used it for the animated navigation as well as the page transitions. It’s an incredibly fun tool to work with.</p>


<h2>Still works great on mobile</h2>

			<p>The funky concept for the desktop version of this website wasn’t going to translate onto a small screen. It was easy to create a simpler version of the site while retaining the exact same content.</p>
